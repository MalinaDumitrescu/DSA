# DSA Containers Implementation in C++

This repository contains a collection of **data structures and algorithms (DSA) implemented in C++**. The main focus is on recreating standard containers such as **maps, matrices, sets, trees, and more**, using various underlying representations.

## ðŸ“Œ Implemented Containers & Representations
- **Custom Data Structures:**
  - Maps
  - Matrices
  - Sets
  - Trees
  - Other fundamental data structures

- **Underlying Representations:**
  - **Dynamic arrays**
  - **Singly Linked List (SLL)**
  - **Singly Linked List with Auxiliary Array (SLLA)**
  - **Other custom implementations**

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Goals
- Reinvent standard containers from scratch to understand their inner workings.
- Explore **memory management** and optimize performance.
- Gain deeper insights into **data structure representation and operations**.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To use or test the implementations, clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-containers.git
